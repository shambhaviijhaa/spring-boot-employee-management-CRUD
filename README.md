# Spring Boot Employee Management CRUD

This repository contains the source code for an Employee Management System built using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML for the frontend. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records stored in a MySQL database.

## Features

- Create new employees with details such as name, age, city, and salary.
- View a list of all employees with their respective details.
- Update employee information by providing new details.
- Delete employees from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Backend framework for building robust and scalable applications.
- **HTML:** Frontend markup language for creating user interfaces.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system for storing employee data.
- **RESTful API:** Communication between frontend and backend using RESTful principles.
- **Git and GitHub:** Version control and repository hosting platform for collaborative development.

This project serves as a practical example of building a full-stack web application with Spring Boot and HTML, showcasing the integration of backend APIs with a simple frontend interface.
